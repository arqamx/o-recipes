    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>These mac and cheese balls are a fun and easy recipe that the kids and guests will all love. It's super cheesy and absolutely one of my faves. No need for spoons with this mac dish!</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (7.25 ounce) package macaroni and cheese mix</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup pimento cheese spread</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
        <li>4 cups peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally until macaroni is cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 7 minutes. Drain. Stir in butter, 1/4 cup milk, and cheese packet from the macaroni and cheese package.</li>
        <li>While macaroni is still hot, stir in Cheddar cheese, pimento cheese spread, and Italian cheese blend, and continue to stir until melted.</li>
        <li>Place the macaroni and cheese mixture into a container and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the macaroni mixture from the refrigerator, and using a cookie scoop, scoop into balls. Place mac balls on the prepared baking sheet and freeze for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make a breading station: Whisk bread crumbs with paprika, chili powder, black pepper, sugar, salt, and cayenne in a shallow dish; set aside. Beat eggs with 3 tablespoons milk in a small bowl. Remove the mac balls from the freezer, coat in egg mixture, and then dredge in breading.</li>
        <li>Fry the mac balls in hot oil in small batches until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain briefly on a paper towel-lined plate; serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
